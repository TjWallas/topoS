This repo is where the development happens.

Example: offending-flows-union-mono can be found with
find access_control_abstraction/thy/ -iname '*.thy' | xargs grep 'offending_flows_union_mono'

Network_Security_Policy_Verification (former access_control_abstraction)
  Theory for reasoning about logical access control abstraction (security policy, who can communicate with whom?)
  All the the formal theory files for Isabelle/HOL

scala_tool
  The tool, quite unmaintained and out of sync with theory files! But isabelle now directly supports visualization. See Network_Security_Policy_Verification.thy for an example.
