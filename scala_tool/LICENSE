    It is up to you to figure out all the licensing stuff.
    
    
    I figured out the following:
    * There is machine generated code that should come with no restrictions (generated by Isabelle)
    * JUNG is BSD
    * collections-generic is Apache License 2.0
    * COLT is CERN
    * jline is BSD-like
    * lift-json is ? but lift is Apache 2.0
    * scalatest is Apache 2.0
    
    -- looks like this software is a real free open source software (no warranty for this statement!)
