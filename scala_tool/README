tool generated with the *.thy files
Status:
  Compiles and runs
  compile with: sbt launcher version 0.13.0
  only 5 compiler warnings
  $ sbt one-jar
  $ sbt run
  >>> visualize-diff-max
    gives you fancy diff-graph (requires graphviz and pdf viewer in $PATH, works flawlessly on ubuntu 12.04, known to work on OSX)
  
  Files:
    graph.json  the directed security policy
    models/*.json  the security invariants

Status for developers:
  The generated code is at src/main/scala/tum/in/net/psn/log_topo/NetworkModels/GENERATED
  Recently, the *.thy files were largely refactored. The interface of the generated code changed. The scala tool is not adaped at the moment (it still runs with the old version). 
  When you create a new version of the generated code from git HEAD, the tool will not compile.
  Will update the tool in the future.
  At the moment, everything works in the theorem prover. For example, look at topoS/access_control_abstraction/thy/i8_ssh_landscape.thy. It even draws nice graphs for you ;)
